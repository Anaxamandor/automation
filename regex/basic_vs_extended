Basic Regular Expressions (BRE) and Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) are two types of regex that differ in their syntax and features. 
Historically, there were differences between them, but over time the features have merged until the functionality is mostly the same. 

BREs are simpler and have fewer features than EREs2. 
The characters ‘?’, ‘+’, ‘{’, ‘|’, ‘(’, and ‘)’ lose their special meaning in BREs; 
instead use the backslashed versions ‘?’, ‘+’, ‘{’, ‘|’, ‘(’, and ‘)’2. 

EREs were extended and had more power1.
