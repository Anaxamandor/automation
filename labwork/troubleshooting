connectivity issues:

try bounding the external connector
the external connector should be on bridge not nat mode
when pinging from a device be sure to ping inside the MGMT vrf

ssh issues:


make sure device has transport input ssh, login local, default route to gate of ISP, username and passwor with privilege 15, crypto key, domain name

before using ansible run ssh on the device to save the keys

if you get this error on Linux terminal when trying to SSH: Bad server host key: Invalid key length, 
and on the Cisco device it says this error:  Unexpected message type has arrived. Terminating the connection from x.x.x.x,
things I tried:
generated a new crypto key on the device. this resolved the error but now it says:
Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive,password)


the only real way to know why sshd is pissed is to look at the sshd logs
Run ssh with Â´-v, it will show you which keys it tries (search for Will attempt key:`)

Unable to negotiate with 172.16.10.5 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1

http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html


the issue behind this is that, at least on IOS and IOS-XE, you can't change the SSH key exchange method to something else than SHA1. To connect from the Ubuntu terminal anyway, you can use this command:

ssh <username>@<ip-address> -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
and/or

ssh <username>@<ip-address> -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
