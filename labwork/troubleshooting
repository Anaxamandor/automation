make sure device has trasnport input ssh, login local, default route to gate of ISP, username and passwor with privilege 15, crypto key, domain name

before using ansible run ssh on the device to save the keys

if you get this error on Linux terminal when trying to SSH: Bad server host key: Invalid key length, 
and on the Cisco device it says this error:  Unexpected message type has arrived. Terminating the connection from x.x.x.x,
things I tried:
generated a new crypto key on the device. this resolved the error but now it says:
