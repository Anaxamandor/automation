Using the --global option will write to the global ~/.gitconfig file.

git config --global core.pager cat
Note: The additional configuration setting, core.pager cat, uses the cat command for git log 
or similar commands rather than less which is the default. 
When you use this setting, you always return to the command prompt rather than paging through results of long Git messages.
