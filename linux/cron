# crontab overview:
-crontab is a program to create, read, update, and delete job schedules
-It is a configuration file that specifies when commands are to be executed by chron
-each line is a job
-the fields are:
Minute (0-59), Hour(0-23), Day of the Month(1-31), Month of the Year(1-12), Day of the Week(0-6)

# crontab example:
0 7 * * 1 /opt/sales/bin/weekly-report
means run every Monday at 07:00

Asterisk means any (? every?)?????

weekly-report is a shell script (I think)????


# email ouptut of chrontab
Output is emailed to you by default.

To not receve output you can redirect it, such as:
0 2 * * * /root/backupdb > /tmp/db.log 2>&1


# crontab shortcut options:
For shortcut options see man chron for your system

# crontab commands:
crontab file   Install a new chrontab from file
crontab -l     List your cron jobs
crontab -e     edit your cron jobs (invokes editor in EDITOR variable)
crontab -r     remove all of your cron jobs


If you use "crontab filename", the contents of the file will overwrite the existing crontab contents completely.  
This is only on a per-user basis, of course - it only overwrites the crontab for the user running the command, 
other users still have their own separate crontabs.
