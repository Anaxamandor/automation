finding files in directories

find [path..] [expression]
-name pattern (finds files and directories that match that pattern)
-iname patter (like -name but ignores case)
-ls (runs ls -l)
-mtime days  (find files that are days old)
-size num (finds files by size)
-newer file (finds files that are newer than file)
-exec command {} \;  (run command against all the files that are found)

examples:

find / -type f -exec grep -H 'text-to-find-here' {} \;

find /bin -name *v

find . -mtime +10 -mtime -13  (find files more than 10 days old but less than 10 days old in current directory)

find . -name s* -ls  (find anything that begins with s and perform an ls -l on it)

find . -size +1M  (files over 1 Megabyte.  Can also use 1G or 1K)

find . -type d -newer file.txt

find . -exec file {} \;   (runs file command against all search results.  file command is 'best guess')



find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'test*'
