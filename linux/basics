man -k SEARCH_TERM

environmental variables:
see contents of variable using echo $VAR_NAME

PATH
- an enviornmental variable that controls the command search path
- contains a list of directories to be searched, in left to right order, separated by colon
- echo $PATH to see the contents

which
- gives location of command you are executed
- if multiple programs with same name exist, whichever is first in PATH will be executed

tac
- displays file contents in reverse line order

cd - previous directory 
echo $OLDPWD shows path of previous directory

executing commands
- can specify a command with a full path
- you can execute command not in $PATH
- ./command means execute in this dir

mkdir [-p] 
rmdir [-p] optional -p creates parent directories
rm -rf directory - recursively removes directory

ls -l output:
permissions, number of links, user, group, size, last modified, file name

ls -F reveals file types so you know if it is a directory /, link @, or executable *

a symbolic link @ is a pointer (like a shorcut)
- used for long file or directory names
- used to indicate the current version of software

ls -t files by time
ls -r reverse order
ls -latr long listing including all files reverse sorted by time  (helpful to see most recent files in case they scroll 
off the screen)

ls -R   list files recursively

not installed by default:
tree    visual output of recursive files
tree -d   list directories only
tree -C   colorize output

ls -d <directory>  list directory name, not contents.  Makes more sense when combined with other options like ls -ld
ls --color  colorize the output  (done by default on RHEL)
