# serial strategy and max_fail_percentage:

- name: Example playbook
  hosts: all
  serial:
    - 10
    - "{{ ansible_play_hosts|length }}"
  max_fail_percentage: 100
  gather_facts: false
  ignore_unreachable: true
  tasks:
    - name: Example task
      ping:
      register: result
      retries: 10
      delay: 10
      until: result.ping == 'pong'
      when: result is failed
      
 
 The serial keyword is a strategy that allows you to control how many hosts are targeted at once during the playbook run. 
 By default, Ansible targets all hosts simultaneously, but the serial keyword allows you to specify a smaller number of hosts to target at a time.
 
 The 10 in the example above means only the playbook against 10 devices at a time
 The {{ ansible_play_hosts|length }}" means after running it on all playbooks, run it on all of them again.
 
 This strategy can be useful in scenarios where you want to limit the number of hosts that are targeted simultaneously to avoid overloading
 the network or the targeted hosts.  It can also be useful in situations where you want to control the order in which hosts are targeted.
 
 You can adjust the number of hosts targeted at a time to fit your specific needs. However, keep in mind that targeting too many hosts at
 once can result in network congestion and may cause issues with the targeted hosts.
 
 you can use the max_fail_percentage parameter of the serial strategy to retry failed hosts or groups of hosts. 
 This will allow you to specify the maximum percentage of failed hosts before the playbook stops retrying.
