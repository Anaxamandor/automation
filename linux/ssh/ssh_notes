#SSH notes

# ssh_known_hosts file

cd /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
less ssh_known_hosts
(info may be hashed in this file)
may be a way to turn off hasing of known hosts in the ssh config files - need to research further for RHEL

# searching for a host
cd /etc/ssh/
ssh-keygen -F <hostname>  --doesn't seem to work, needs more research

#creating keys
cd /etc/ssh
ssh-keygen  (this will create a key pair in this folder, there are some options to change the default name and encryption, check man pages)
