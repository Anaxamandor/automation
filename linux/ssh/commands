#searching for a host in ssh_known_hosts

ssh-keygen -f x.x.x.x  (searches ssh_known_hosts file for the hostname)

it's possible that it's listed under a different name or format, such as the host name or an alias. 
You can try using ssh-keygen -F hostname or ssh-keygen -F alias instead, where hostname is the actual host name of x.x.x.x,
or alias is any alias you may have configured for the host.

Alternatively, you can also try using the grep command to search for the host's public key in the known_hosts file. For example, 
grep x.x.x.x ~/.ssh/known_hosts will search for any line that contains the string "x.x.x.x" in the known_hosts file.
