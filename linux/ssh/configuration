CONFIGURING SSH CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN SERVERS:

#create ssh key on server:
ssh-keygen 
#accept the defaults
#list the keys to verify. id_rsa is private key, id_rsa.pub is public key
ls .ssh
#copy the public key to other machines
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub <target hostname>
#may fail if ssh not enabled on target machine, so can go to target machine and enable:
sudo apt isntall openssh-server
#run command again on original machine, yes to trust, enter root pass on target machine
#test access
ssh <hostname>
exit

ALLOW SERVER (SUCH AS ANSBILE) TO EXECUTE SOME COMMANDS WITHOUT CONFIGURING A PASSWORD:
ssh to target machine
sudo visudo
#very bottom of file add:
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
#test if it works.  If it does not prompt for a password this time, it worked:
sudo visudo
#save change
:wq
