The pipe itself is a type of redirect.  Using the pipe "|", you tell the shell to redirect the standard output of the command to the left of the | to the standard input of the command to the right of the |.

For example:

echo "Reverse me." | rev

The output of the echo command is "Reverse me.", and that will be used as input to the rev command (which will reverse the text sent to it as input).

You could use 2>&1 with a pipe, but you would only do that if you want to pass standard error as well as standard output to the input of the next command.  For example:

ls notafile 2>&1 | rev

That would output an ls error message in reverse.
