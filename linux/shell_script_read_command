use read to accept input (STDIN)

#STDIN can come from:
1. user typing 
2. other sources like output of a command in a command pipeline

#syntax
read -p "PROMPT" VARIABLE

#example script:

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a user name: " USER
echo "Archiving user: $USER"

# Lock the account
passwd -l $USER

# Create an archive of the home directory.
tar cf /archives/${USER}.tar.gz /home/${USER}
