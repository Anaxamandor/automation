check if systems are alive (full connection scan):
  sudo nmap -sP x.x.x.x/xx  (or just the host)
  by default this scans the most popular 1000 ports
  
check for open ports:
  sudo nmap -sT -p 80,443 x.x.x.x/xx
  
more stealthy (SYN /half-open) scan (may not avoid more advanced firewalls/IPS): 
  sudo nmap -sS -p 80,443 x.x.x.x/xx
  
man nmap  (to see other switches)

you can use a switch to lower the speed of the scan

to see operating systems used:
  sudo nmap -O x.x.x.x
  
combo search:
  sudo nmap -A x.x.x.x
  
use a decoy:  
  sudo nmap -sS -D x.x.x.x y.y.y.y (where x's are the decoy IP you want to appear as)
  
there are also nmap scripts available:
  sudo nmap --script vuln x.x.x.x (vuln keyword uses all scripts in that category)
  
show status as scanning: --stats-every 2s  (2s means 2 seconds, or m for minutes, h for hours)
