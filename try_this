In Ansible, I registered a variable that contains the following data as the value:
my_var = [ { "name_0": [1,2,3,4] }, { 'name_1": [1,2,3,4] } ]
Please create a task that loops over my_var.
The task should use the ios_config module to print out a list of commands.
The commands should be "no key {{  y where y iterates through each of the numbers in my_var.
The parents: directive shoud have a command "interface loopback x", where x iterates through the two keys (name_0 and name1).



- name: Example task
  ios_config:
    parents: "interface loopback {{ item.key }}"
    lines:
      - "no key {{ item.value }}"
  loop: "{{ my_var }}"
  loop_control:
    label: "{{ item.key }}"

In this task, we're using the ios_config module to configure IOS devices. 
The parents parameter specifies the parent configuration mode for each command, 
which in this case is "interface loopback x", where x iterates through the two keys (name_0 and name_1). 
The lines parameter specifies the commands to execute, which are "no key {{ y }}" where y iterates through 
each of the numbers in the respective lists.

We're using the loop directive to iterate over my_var, and the loop_control directive to set the 
label for each item to the key of the loop iteration.
