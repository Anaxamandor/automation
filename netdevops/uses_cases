Network automation is used for various common tasks in an organization:

 Device provisioning: Device provisioning is likely one of the first things that comes mind
when thinking about network automation. Device provisioning is simply configuring
network devices more efficiently, faster, and with fewer errors because human
interaction with each network device is decreased.

 Device software management: Controlling the download and deployment of software
updates is a relatively simple task, but it can be time-consuming and may fall prey to
human error. Many automated tools have been created to address this issue, but they
can lag behind customer requirements. A simple network programmability solution for
device software management is beneficial in many environments.

 Compliance checks: Network automation methods allow the unique ability to quickly
audit large groups of network devices for configuration errors and automatically make
the appropriate corrections with built-in regression tests.
 Reporting: Automation decreases the manual effort that is needed to extract information
and coordinate data from disparate information sources to create meaningful and
human-readable reports.

 Troubleshooting: Network automation makes troubleshooting easier by making
configuration analysis and real-time error checking fast and simple, even with many
network devices.

 Data collection and telemetry: A common part of effectively maintaining a network is
collecting data from network devices and telemetry on network behavior. Even the way
data is collected is changing as now many devices can push data (and stream) off box,
in real-time, in contrast to being polled in regular time intervals.


# Example project ideas:

There’s a lot of licensed software that can do this, but if you don’t have them in your environment, 
a tool for standardization could be useful. Make sure any required ACLs are present, VLAN numbers are correct. 

You could also utilize EEM on Cisco devices to do some logic for you. Automatically bounce ports or reconfigure routing protocols based on some test.
Scripts for bulk configuration could be useful (and sometimes dangerous). 

If you have ACI in a data center environment, having some Ansible playbooks on hand is incredibly useful. 

Using Genie to learn all and do a diff before and after configs are changed is also handy. 
Best advice though, ask around your department for tasks people find tedious and reoccurring. Build a tool for whatever that is.

A program similar to Intermapper where you have a live map of equipment with their topologies. Then use an API to integrate it with monitoring tools and backups.
