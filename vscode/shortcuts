# multi-cursor editing 
Yes, in VSCode you can use multi-cursor editing to edit multiple lines of code simultaneously. Here's how to do it:

To add a new cursor, place your cursor on the first line you want to edit and press Alt + Shift + Down Arrow (Windows, Linux) or Option + Shift + Down Arrow (Mac). This will create a new cursor on the next line.

Repeat the previous step to add as many cursors as you need.

Once you have multiple cursors, you can type in text and it will be added to all the lines at once.

To move all the cursors up or down, press Alt + Up Arrow/Down Arrow (Windows, Linux) or Option + Up Arrow/Down Arrow (Mac).

To remove a cursor, simply move it to a different location using the arrow keys or mouse.

With multi-cursor editing, you can quickly make changes to multiple lines of code at once, which can be a huge time-saver.
