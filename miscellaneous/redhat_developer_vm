# registring a vM to Red Hat

First I renewed the subscription (not sure, how apparently by just logging in again)


Not sure if this helped but followed this guidance first and entered the commands in this document:
https://developers.redhat.com/articles/renew-your-red-hat-developer-program-subscription#troubleshooting

It still didn't work.  

Then I created a new system under the subscription page with the same parameters, and called it robot which is the same name as the VM hostname, gave it 1 vpcu, other details filled in.


Then I put this command into the command line and it worked:


subscription-manager register --username ****** --password ****** --auto-attach
