If Ansible cannot connect to a host, it marks that host as ‘UNREACHABLE’ and removes it from the list of active hosts for the run. 
You can use meta: clear_host_errors to reactivate all hosts, so subsequent tasks can try to reach them again.

explanation:
ansible will keep track of failed/unreachable hosts so these hosts and will exclude them from further tasks. 
clear_host_errors resets the state so the host will be tried again for further tasks

and example would be using a rescue module after that
