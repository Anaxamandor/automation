In Ansible, the pause module is used to pause a playbook or task for a specified amount of time. The echo parameter of the pause module is used to 
display a message to the user while the playbook or task is paused.

The echo parameter is an optional parameter that takes a string value. When this parameter is used, the message specified in the string value will be
displayed to the user on the console or terminal while the playbook or task is paused.

Here is an example of how to use the pause module with the echo parameter:

- name: Pause for user input
  pause:
    seconds: 5
    prompt: "Please press any key to continue..."
    echo: "Pausing for 5 seconds..."
    
In the example above, the pause module is used to pause the playbook for 5 seconds and display a message to the user saying "Pausing for 5 seconds...". 
The prompt parameter is also used to prompt the user to press any key to continue after the pause.

# use cases of pause module:

The pause module in Ansible is a simple but useful tool that can be used in various cases. Here are some examples of when the pause module can be useful:

Waiting for user input: You can use the pause module to pause a playbook or task and prompt the user to provide input before continuing. This can be useful 
when you need to confirm an action or ask the user to provide some information during the playbook execution.

Delaying the playbook execution: You can use the pause module to delay the execution of a playbook or task for a specified amount of time. This can be useful 
when you need to wait for a system to finish a specific operation or when you want to control the pace of the playbook execution.

Creating a pause for troubleshooting: You can use the pause module to create a pause in the playbook execution at a specific point, allowing you to 
troubleshoot the playbook step by step. This can be useful when you need to debug complex playbooks or tasks and want to check the intermediate results of each step.

Displaying messages to the user: You can use the echo parameter of the pause module to display messages to the user during the playbook execution. 
This can be useful when you want to provide status updates, progress indicators, or any other type of message to the user.
