You can use the Ansible module "lineinfile" to append a line to a CSV file with the values you want to export. 
Here's an example of how you can modify your playbook to accomplish this:

- name: Example playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create list variable
      set_fact:
        my_list: ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']

    - name: Export variable to CSV
      lineinfile:
        path: /path/to/my/file.csv
        line: "{{ inventory_hostname }},{{ my_list | join(',') }}"
        
In this example, we first create the variable "my_list" using the "set_fact" module. 
Next, we use the "lineinfile" module to append a line to the CSV file. 
The "path" parameter specifies the path to the CSV file, while the "line" parameter contains the values we want to export. 
We use the "join" filter to concatenate the items in the "my_list" variable into a comma-separated string.
Each time this playbook runs against a host, it will append a new line to the CSV file with the values for that host. 
The first column will contain the value of "inventory_hostname" for that host, 
while the second column will contain the comma-separated list of items in the "my_list" variable.


Adjustment need however, do to possible overwriting issues!

Since this playbook is running on all hosts (hosts: all), and each host will execute the lineinfile task in parallel by default, 
there is a possibility that multiple forks may write to the same file at the same time, causing file overwriting issues.

To prevent this issue, you can modify the playbook to use the run_once: true option for the lineinfile task to ensure that it is 
only executed once. Here's an example of how you can modify your playbook:

- name: Example playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create list variable
      set_fact:
        my_list: ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']

    - name: Export variable to CSV
      lineinfile:
        path: /path/to/my/file.csv
        line: "{{ inventory_hostname }},{{ my_list | join(',') }}"
      run_once: true


With this modification, the lineinfile task will only be executed once, ensuring that there are no file overwriting issues.

With this revision, the CSV file will have one row for each target device specified in your inventory.

The run_once: true option ensures that the lineinfile task is executed only once, 
but since the playbook is running on all hosts (hosts: all), the task will be executed once on each target device.

The inventory_hostname variable used in the line parameter will be replaced with the hostname of the target device
that the task is running on. So, for example, if your inventory has three devices with hostnames "device1", "device2", and "device3", 
then the resulting CSV file will have three rows, one for each device, with the device hostname and the values of the my_list variable.
