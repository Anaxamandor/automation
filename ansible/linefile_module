You can use the Ansible module "lineinfile" to append a line to a CSV file with the values you want to export. 
Here's an example of how you can modify your playbook to accomplish this:

- name: Example playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create list variable
      set_fact:
        my_list: ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']

    - name: Export variable to CSV
      lineinfile:
        path: /path/to/my/file.csv
        line: "{{ inventory_hostname }},{{ my_list | join(',') }}"
        
In this example, we first create the variable "my_list" using the "set_fact" module. 
Next, we use the "lineinfile" module to append a line to the CSV file. 
The "path" parameter specifies the path to the CSV file, while the "line" parameter contains the values we want to export. 
We use the "join" filter to concatenate the items in the "my_list" variable into a comma-separated string.
Each time this playbook runs against a host, it will append a new line to the CSV file with the values for that host. 
The first column will contain the value of "inventory_hostname" for that host, 
while the second column will contain the comma-separated list of items in the "my_list" variable.
