You can use the map() filter in Ansible to convert a list of strings to a list of integers. Here's an example:

- name: Convert list of strings to list of ints
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    string_list:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
  tasks:
    - name: Convert list
      set_fact:
        int_list: "{{ string_list | map('int') | list }}"
    - name: Debug
      debug:
        var: int_list

n this example, we first define a list of strings called string_list.

We then use the map() filter with the int function to convert each string to an integer, 
and then use the list filter to convert the resulting map object to a list. 

The resulting list of integers is stored in the int_list variable.

Finally, we use the debug module to print out the value of int_list.

Note that the map() filter was introduced in Ansible 2.5, so if you are using an earlier version of Ansible, 
you will need to use a different approach, such as a loop with the to_int filter.
