The items2dict filter is the opposite of the dict2items filter: it converts a list of key-value pairs into a dictionary.
Here's an example of how to use items2dict filter in an Ansible playbook:

---
- name: Convert items to dictionary
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    my_list:
      - key: name
        value: John
      - key: age
        value: 30
      - key: city
        value: New York

  tasks:
    - name: Convert items to dictionary
      debug:
        var: my_dict
      vars:
        my_dict: "{{ my_list | items2dict }}"

Let's go through this playbook line by line:

--- indicates the start of a YAML file, which is the format Ansible uses for playbooks.
- name: Convert items to dictionary is a playbook name. It's a human-readable description of what this playbook does.
hosts: localhost specifies the target host or hosts on which this playbook will run. In this case, we're just running it on the local machine.
gather_facts: false disables the gathering of facts from the target host(s), such as hardware information, operating system, etc.
vars: defines a variable called my_list that contains a list of key-value pairs.
tasks: is a list of tasks to be executed on the target host(s).
- name: Convert items to dictionary is the name of the first task.
debug: is a module that prints messages to the console.
var: my_dict is an option that specifies the variable to print.
vars: is a list of variables to set for this task.
my_dict: "{{ my_list | items2dict }}" is a variable that sets the my_dict variable to the dictionary generated by the items2dict filter.
When we run this playbook, we should see the following output:

TASK [Convert items to dictionary] *********************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "my_dict": {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York"
    }
}

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0

As you can see, the items2dict filter converts the my_list variable into a dictionary that is printed to the console using the debug module. 
The my_dict variable is set using the vars option, and its value is the result of applying the items2dict filter to the my_list variable.
