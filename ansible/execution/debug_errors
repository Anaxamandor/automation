you can use the template module to generate a single file that contains the IOS ios_facts failure message from each device. Here's an updated example playbook that demonstrates how to do this:

- name: Example playbook
  hosts: ios_devices
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
    - name: Gathering facts
      ios_facts:
      register: facts_result
      ignore_errors: true

    - name: Collect error messages
      set_fact:
        error_messages: "{{ error_messages | default([]) + [{'host': inventory_hostname, 'msg': facts_result.msg}] }}"
      when: facts_result.failed

    - name: Generate error message file
      template:
        src: error_message_template.j2
        dest: "/var/log/ios_facts_errors.log"
      when: inventory_hostname == groups['ios_devices'][-1]

In this updated example, the ios_facts module is used to gather facts for IOS devices, and the register option is used to save the result of the task into the facts_result variable. The ignore_errors option is used to prevent Ansible from stopping the playbook execution if the ios_facts task fails.

Then, the set_fact module is used to append the error message to a list called error_messages if the ios_facts task fails. The error_messages list contains a dictionary with two keys: host (the hostname of the device) and msg (the error message from the ios_facts task). The when condition is used to check if the failed attribute of the facts_result variable is true, indicating that the task has failed.

After that, the template module is used to generate a log file that contains the error messages from all devices. The src option specifies the path to a Jinja2 template file that will be used to generate the log file. The dest option specifies the path and filename of the output file. The when condition is used to ensure that the template task is only executed on the last host in the ios_devices group.

Here's an example Jinja2 template file named error_message_template.j2:

{% for message in error_messages %}
Gathering facts failed on {{ message.host }}:
{{ message.msg }}

{% endfor %}


This template will generate an error message for each device that has a failed ios_facts task, and append it to the log file.

When this playbook is run, the error messages will be collected from all devices and then used to generate a log file that contains the error messages from all devices in a single file.

More detailed explanation: of:
error_messages: "{{ error_messages | default([]) + [{'host': inventory_hostname, 'msg': facts_result.msg}] }}"

error_messages is a variable that we are creating or updating.
default([]) specifies that if error_messages doesn't exist or is empty, it should default to an empty list []. This is because we want to append each error message to a list.
+ is the concatenation operator for lists in Python. We are concatenating the existing value of error_messages (which may be an empty list) with a new list that contains a single dictionary.
[{'host': inventory_hostname, 'msg': facts_result.msg}] is a list containing a single dictionary with two keys:
host: This key has a value of inventory_hostname, which is the hostname of the device being managed by Ansible.
msg: This key has a value of facts_result.msg, which is the error message generated by the ios_facts module if it fails.
So essentially, this line of code is creating or updating a list called error_messages. If the list doesn't exist yet or is empty, it initializes it with an empty list []. Then it concatenates the existing value of error_messages with a new list containing a dictionary with the host and msg keys and their respective values. Finally, the result is stored in the error_messages variable.

This line of code is used to collect error messages from all IOS devices that have a failed ios_facts task, and append them to the error_messages list.

The reason we put the dictionary in a list is because we want to create a list of error messages, where each item in the list represents the error message for a specific host. In other words, we want to have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the error message and the name of the host where the error occurred.

By putting the dictionary inside a list, we are able to easily append the dictionary to the list, which allows us to collect multiple error messages from multiple hosts. If we didn't put the dictionary inside a list, we would only be able to store a single error message, because the error_messages variable would be overwritten each time a new error message is collected.

Therefore, by using a list, we can store multiple dictionaries (each representing an error message from a different host), and then iterate over the list to generate the final log file that contains all the error messages.

More detailed explanation of:
when: facts_result.failed


The when statement in Ansible is a conditional statement that allows us to control when a task or role should be executed based on certain conditions. In this case, when: facts_result.failed is a condition that checks whether the facts_result object generated by the ios_facts module has failed or not.

Here's how it works:

When Ansible runs the ios_facts module to gather facts about an IOS device, it generates a facts_result object that contains information about the success or failure of the task.
If the ios_facts task is successful, facts_result.failed will be False, because there was no failure.
If the ios_facts task fails, facts_result.failed will be True, because there was a failure.
Therefore, in this specific case, when: facts_result.failed is telling Ansible to only execute the task that follows (which in this case is the set_fact task that adds the error message to the error_messages list) if the ios_facts task failed. If the ios_facts task was successful, Ansible will skip the set_fact task and move on to the next task in the playbook, because there is no error message to add to the error_messages list.

By using this conditional statement, we can ensure that we only collect error messages from IOS devices where the ios_facts task has failed, and ignore devices where the task was successful.

more detailed explanation of:
when: inventory_hostname == groups['ios_devices'][-1]

The when statement in Ansible is a conditional statement that allows us to control when a task or role should be executed based on certain conditions. In this case, when: inventory_hostname == groups['ios_devices'][-1] is a condition that checks whether the current host being managed by Ansible is the last host in a group called ios_devices.

Here's how it works:

inventory_hostname is a variable in Ansible that represents the hostname of the current host being managed.
groups['ios_devices'] is a reference to a group of hosts in the inventory file that have been tagged with the ios_devices group.
[-1] is an index that selects the last item in the ios_devices group.
Therefore, inventory_hostname == groups['ios_devices'][-1] is telling Ansible to only execute the task that follows (which in this case is the template task that generates the log file) if the current host being managed by Ansible is the last host in the ios_devices group.

By using this conditional statement, we can ensure that the log file is only generated once, after all IOS devices in the ios_devices group have been managed. This is because the template task is only executed on the last host in the ios_devices group, and all other hosts will skip the task.

It is important to check that the current host being managed is the last one in the ios_devices group before generating the log file because we want to ensure that all IOS devices have been processed before generating the log file.

When working with multiple hosts in Ansible, it is possible for tasks to be executed in parallel across different hosts. This means that when we use the ios_facts module to gather facts from IOS devices, we cannot guarantee the order in which the facts are collected. This can be a problem if we want to generate a log file that contains all the error messages from all the devices, because we need to make sure that all the devices have been processed before we generate the log file.

By checking that the current host being managed is the last one in the ios_devices group, we can be sure that all the IOS devices in the group have been processed before we generate the log file. This ensures that all the error messages have been collected and that the log file is complete. Without this check, we may generate a log file that is missing error messages from some of the IOS devices, because those devices may not have been processed yet when the log file was generated.

Therefore, by checking that the current host being managed is the last one in the ios_devices group, we can ensure that the log file is generated only once, after all the IOS devices have been processed, and that the log file contains all the error messages from all the devices.
