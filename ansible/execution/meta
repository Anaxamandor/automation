# use cases of meta module:

The meta module in Ansible is a powerful module that performs various high-level operations on the target hosts. 
Some common uses of the meta module in Ansible are:

refresh_inventory: This option refreshes the inventory on the control node by re-reading the inventory sources. 
It can be useful when you have added or removed hosts from your inventory and want to update Ansible's internal representation of your infrastructure.

clear_facts: This option clears the cached facts for the target hosts. Facts are information about the target hosts that Ansible gathers and caches 
during play execution. Clearing facts can be useful when you want to ensure that the facts are up-to-date or when you want to free up memory.

end_play: This option immediately ends the current play, skipping any remaining tasks in the play. This can be useful in situations where you want 
to abort a play early, such as when a critical error occurs.

noop: This option is a no-operation that does not execute any tasks but reports what would have happened. 
It can be useful for testing and debugging playbooks without actually making changes to the target hosts.

validate: This option validates the syntax of the playbook without actually executing any tasks. 
This can be useful for catching syntax errors before running a playbook on the target hosts.

Overall, the meta module provides a way to perform various high-level operations on the target hosts 
and can be used in a variety of situations to make playbook execution more efficient and effective.

If Ansible cannot connect to a host, it marks that host as ‘UNREACHABLE’ and removes it from the list of active hosts for the run. 
You can use meta: clear_host_errors to reactivate all hosts, so subsequent tasks can try to reach them again.

Ansible will keep track of failed/unreachable hosts and will exclude them from further tasks. 
clear_host_errors resets the state so the host will be tried again for further tasks

and example would be using a rescue module after that
