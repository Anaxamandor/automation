ansible_play_hosts is a list of the hosts that are being targeted by the current play or playbook. 
This list is updated dynamically as the playbook execution progresses and may not contain all the hosts at the beginning of the playbook execution. 
For example, if you use the serial strategy to execute tasks on a subset of hosts at a time, ansible_play_hosts will only contain the hosts that are 
currently being targeted.

On the other hand, ansible_play_hosts_all is a list of all the hosts that are being targeted by the current play or playbook. 
This list is generated at the beginning of the playbook execution and contains all the hosts that are being targeted, 
even if some of them are not currently reachable or are being targeted in later plays.

ansible_play_hosts only contains the hosts that are currently being targeted, while ansible_play_hosts_all contains all the hosts that are being targeted, 
even if they are being targeted in later plays or are not currently reachable.
