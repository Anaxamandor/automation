# how to determine the number of forks that will be possible to use:

The maximum number of forks that you can configure for Ansible on a RHEL system depends on the system's available resources such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O. In general, the more resources available, the more forks you can configure.

Here are some general guidelines for determining the maximum number of forks you can configure on a RHEL system:

CPU: The number of forks you can configure is directly related to the number of available CPU cores on the system. You can use the lscpu command to determine the number of CPU cores on your system.

Memory: Each fork requires some amount of memory to run, so the amount of available memory on the system will limit the number of forks you can configure. You can use the free -m command to check the amount of available memory on your system.

Disk I/O: The amount of disk I/O that each fork generates can also limit the number of forks you can configure. If the system's disk I/O is saturated, adding more forks may not improve performance and may actually degrade it.

Based on these guidelines, you can start by setting the forks parameter to a value equal to the number of available CPU cores on your system and then gradually increase it while monitoring system performance to find the optimal value. You can also consult with your system administrator or hardware vendor for guidance on the maximum number of forks that your system can support.


#  General info on forks:

The number of forks that RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) can manage when using Ansible is determined by the value of the forks parameter in the Ansible configuration file.

The forks parameter determines the number of parallel processes or threads that Ansible will use to execute tasks on the managed hosts. By default, the value of forks is set to 5, which means that Ansible will execute tasks on up to 5 hosts in parallel.

To determine the number of forks that RHEL can manage when using Ansible, you can check the value of the forks parameter in the Ansible configuration file on the RHEL system. The location of the Ansible configuration file can vary depending on how Ansible was installed and configured on the system, but it is typically located at /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg.

Open the Ansible configuration file in a text editor and look for the forks parameter. If it is not specified in the file, the default value of 5 will be used. You can change the value of forks in the configuration file to a higher or lower value based on your system's hardware capabilities and workload requirements.

But how do i know how many forks I can configure, based on the RHEL system that Ansible is installed on?
