Handlers notified within the roles section are automatically flushed at the end of the tasks section, but before any tasks handlers.

translation: 
Handlers can run in multiple places, after pre_tasks, roles and tasks. This sentence is pretty much saying that after the roles are done, handlers will run.

flushed, means "ran and removed from queue"

example:

- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  handlers:
    - name: some handler
      debug:
        msg: "ran handler!"
  pre_tasks:
    - command: whoami
      notify: some handler
  # Handler will run here
  tasks:
    - command: whoami
      notify: some handler
  # And here
  post_tasks:
    - command: whoami
      notify: some handler
  # And here
