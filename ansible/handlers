Handlers notified within the roles section are automatically flushed at the end of the tasks section, but before any tasks handlers.

translation: 
Handlers can run in multiple places, after pre_tasks, roles and tasks. This sentence is pretty much saying that after the roles are done, handlers will run.

flushed, means "ran and removed from queue"
