The map filter in Ansible can take a variety of data types,
including lists, dictionaries, and strings. 

When the map filter is applied to a list, it returns a new list where each element is 
transformed according to the given transformation function. 

When applied to a dictionary, it returns a new dictionary with the same keys 
as the original but with the values transformed by the given transformation function. 

When applied to a string, it treats the string as a list of characters 
and applies the transformation function to each character in the string.

The map filter can be used to iterate over a string character by character, 
or it can be used to split a string into a list of words. 
The behavior of the filter depends on the transformation function that is passed to it.

By default, if no transformation function is specified, the map filter 
will treat the input as a list of characters and iterate over each character. 
For example, if you use the map filter like this:

{{ my_string | map }}

It will split my_string into a list of characters and iterate over each character, returning a list like this:

['c', 'a', 't']

However, if you specify a transformation function, like this:

{{ my_string | map('split') }}

It will split my_string into a list of words and iterate over each word, returning a list like this:

[["Hello"], ["world,"], ["how"], ["are"], ["you"], ["doing?"]]

The split function splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified separator (which is by default a whitespace character). 
The resulting list consists of the words in the original string.

# using the map filter with the attribute function on a string:

{{ show_command_output.stdout | regex_findall(regex) | first | map('attribute', '0') | first }}

The regex_findall filter returns a list of strings that match the provided regular expression. 
The first filter then returns the first element of that list. 
The map filter is then applied to that single string, 
and it treats the string as a list of attributes. 

In this case, it takes the first attribute (indicated by '0') and returns it. 

So the map filter is not treating the string as a list of characters, but rather as a list of attributes (or words in this specific case).

When the attribute function is used in the map filter, 
it tells the filter to treat each character in the string as an attribute of an object, 
rather than treating the string as a list of characters. 

This allows you to extract a specific attribute from each character in the string, 
rather than operating on each character individually.

In programming, an attribute is a characteristic or property of an object. 
For example, in Python, a variable can be defined as an object, and that object 
can have various attributes such as its data type, value, length, etc.

example:

Here's an example of how map would work on the string 'hello':
Python:
{{ 'hello' | map('upper') }}
Output:
[u'H', u'E', u'L', u'L', u'O']

As you can see, the map filter has treated the string 'hello' as a list of characters 
and applied the upper function to each character in the string, resulting in a list of uppercase characters.

The 'u' that appears before each element in the list is a Python 2.x notation indicating that the string is a Unicode string. 
In Python 3.x, Unicode strings are the default, and so the 'u' notation is not used.
