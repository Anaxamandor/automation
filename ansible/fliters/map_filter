The map filter in Ansible can take a variety of data types,
including lists, dictionaries, and strings. 

When the map filter is applied to a list, it returns a new list where each element is 
transformed according to the given transformation function. 

When applied to a dictionary, it returns a new dictionary with the same keys 
as the original but with the values transformed by the given transformation function. 

When applied to a string, it treats the string as a list of characters 
and applies the transformation function to each character in the string.

The map filter can be used to iterate over a string character by character, 
or it can be used to split a string into a list of words. 
The behavior of the filter depends on the transformation function that is passed to it.

By default, if no transformation function is specified, the map filter 
will treat the input as a list of characters and iterate over each character. 
For example, if you use the map filter like this:

{{ my_string | map }}

It will split my_string into a list of characters and iterate over each character, returning a list like this:

['c', 'a', 't']

However, if you specify a transformation function, like this:

{{ my_string | map('split') }}

It will split my_string into a list of words and iterate over each word, returning a list like this:

[["Hello"], ["world,"], ["how"], ["are"], ["you"], ["doing?"]]

The split function splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified separator (which is by default a whitespace character). 
The resulting list consists of the words in the original string.
