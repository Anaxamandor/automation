The map filter in Ansible can take a variety of data types,
including lists, dictionaries, and strings. 

When the map filter is applied to a list, it returns a new list where each element is 
transformed according to the given transformation function. 

When applied to a dictionary, it returns a new dictionary with the same keys 
as the original but with the values transformed by the given transformation function. 

When applied to a string, it treats the string as a list of characters 
and applies the transformation function to each character in the string.
