The | splitlines filter in Ansible is used to split a string into a list of strings based on line breaks. 
It works by splitting the input string on the newline (\n) character and returning a list of the resulting lines. 
This is useful when working with command output that contains multiple lines, as it allows you to easily process each line individually.

example:

{{ show_output.stdout | splitlines | map('regex_findall', 'GigabitEthernet\\d+') | list }}
