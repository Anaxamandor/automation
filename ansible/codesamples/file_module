    - name: "Update file permissions"  #The prior task set permissions to 700 and this task will tighten the file permissions to 644. That means it's user-writeable but not executable, and read-write for groups and everyone. Copy this snippet to the
      file:
        path: /home/developer/src/ansible/hello
        mode: 700
    - name: "Update file content from template"
      template:
        src: /home/developer/src/ansible/hello-template.j2
        dest: /home/developer/src/ansible/hello
        mode: 0644
        
        # Next, you'll create a template file named hello-template.j2, where {{you}} is the 
        # replacement you'll make when running the playbook. In an editor you would type Hello {{you}} 
        # and then save the file as hello-template.j2. In the command line environment you can run this echo 
        # and output redirection command to create a Jinja2 template file.
        
        #Jinja2 is the templating mechanism that Ansible uses for dynamic expressions and access to variables in Ansible, 
        # hence the .j2 file type. In this case, the variable is {{you}}:
        
        # To run the playbook, you use the ansible-playbook CLI, pass in the hosts inventory file with 
        # the -i parameter, and give it the name of the playbook file. In addition, 
        # you pass in the value you want to insert for the {{you}} variable:
        #  ansible-playbook -i hosts writefile.yml -e you=Cisco
