There could be several reasons why some of your devices are failing during the task. Here are some possibilities:

Memory: The devices that are failing may have insufficient memory to perform the task. The regex expression may be using too much memory, causing the device to crash or hang.

CPU utilization: The task may be using too much CPU, causing the device to slow down or become unresponsive. This can be due to a number of factors, including inefficient code or excessive background processes.

Hardware issues: The devices that are failing may have hardware issues that are causing the task to fail. This could include faulty RAM, hard drive errors, or other issues.

Configuration differences: The devices may have different configurations, such as different versions of software or different hardware components, which could be causing the issue.

Network connectivity: The devices may be experiencing network connectivity issues that are causing the task to fail. This could be due to issues with the network infrastructure, such as a faulty router or switch.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following steps:

Check the memory and CPU utilization on the failing devices to see if they are running out of resources during the task.

Look for any hardware issues on the failing devices, such as errors in the system logs or diagnostic tools.

Compare the configurations of the failing devices with those of the working devices to see if there are any differences that could be causing the issue.

Check the network connectivity between the devices to see if there are any issues with the network infrastructure.

By identifying the root cause of the issue, you can take steps to resolve it and prevent future failures.



Check Memory and CPU Utilization:
To check the memory and CPU utilization of a device running IOX-XE, you can use the following commands:

show processes memory: This command displays the current memory usage of all processes running on the device. You can use this command to check if the device is running out of memory during the task.

show processes cpu: This command displays the current CPU utilization of all processes running on the device. You can use this command to check if the device is experiencing high CPU usage during the task.

If the device is running out of memory or experiencing high CPU usage during the task, you may need to optimize the task or add more resources to the device.

Look for Hardware Issues:
To check for hardware issues on a device running IOX-XE, you can use the following commands:

show hardware: This command displays information about the hardware components of the device, including any errors or issues that have been detected.

show environment: This command displays the environmental variables of the device, including temperature and power supply status.

If there are any hardware issues detected, you may need to replace the faulty component or seek assistance from the hardware vendor.

Compare Configurations:
To compare the configurations of devices running IOX-XE, you can use the following commands:

show running-config: This command displays the current running configuration of the device.

show startup-config: This command displays the configuration that is loaded at startup.

You can compare the output of these commands on the failing devices with those of the working devices to see if there are any differences that could be causing the issue. Additionally, you can use the diff command to compare the configurations side-by-side.

If there are any configuration differences that are causing the issue, you may need to adjust the configuration on the failing devices to match that of the working devices.

Check Network Connectivity:
To check the network connectivity of devices running IOX-XE, you can use the following commands:

ping: This command sends ICMP packets to a specified destination and measures the response time. You can use this command to check if the device is able to communicate with other devices on the network.

traceroute: This command traces the route that packets take from the device to a specified destination, showing each hop along the way. You can use this command to identify any network connectivity issues along the path.

If there are any network connectivity issues, you may need to troubleshoot the network infrastructure, such as checking for faulty routers or switches.

By using these troubleshooting steps and commands, you can identify the root cause of the issue and take steps to resolve it on devices running IOX-XE.
