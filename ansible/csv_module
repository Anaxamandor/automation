ou can use the Ansible module "csv_file" to output the information 
collected from all devices to a single csv file. 
Here's an example playbook that demonstrates how to do this:

---
- name: Collect information from devices
  hosts: devices

  tasks:
    - name: Collect x, y, and z information
      # your task to collect x, y, and z information goes here

    - name: Append to CSV file
      csv_file:
        path: /path/to/csv/file.csv
        delimiter: ','
        mode: append
        columns:
          - device_name
          - x
          - y
          - z
        data:
          - "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          - "{{ x }}"
          - "{{ y }}"
          - "{{ z }}"


In this example, we're collecting information from all devices in the "devices" group. 
The first task collects the x, y, and z information, but the details will depend on how 
you are collecting this information. The second task uses the "csv_file" module to 
append the collected information to a CSV file.

In the "csv_file" task, we specify the path to the CSV file, the delimiter (in this case, a comma), 
and the mode as "append" to ensure that we're adding to the file instead of overwriting it. We also 
specify the columns that we want to include in the CSV file, which are the device name, x, y, and z information.

Finally, we use Ansible variables ({{ inventory_hostname }}, {{ x }}, {{ y }}, and {{ z }}) to populate the data 
for each row of the CSV file. This assumes that you've defined variables for the x, y, and z information earlier in the playbook.
