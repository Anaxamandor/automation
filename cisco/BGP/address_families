no bgp default ipv4 (keeps it from automatically putting bgp config into ipv4 address-family)

on newer devices you have to it this way:

router bgp XXX
address-family ipv4 unicast
neighbor x.x.x.x activate  (address families must be activated for neighbor relationships to come to life. Otherwise they stay in idle)
network x.x.x.x mask x.x.x.x


BUT if the route exists in a vrf:
address-family ipv4 unicast vrf VRF
