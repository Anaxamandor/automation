In iBGP, internally learned routes are not forwarded

route reflectors are configured for each address family

RR solve the problem of needing a full mesh which helps scalability in larger toplogies

reflectors bounce the info unchanged.  To fix this need to use a route map inbound to fix next hop


with RR, routes learned (received) behave as follows:
1. advertisements from non-clients -> RR ->  clients only
2. advertisements from clients -> RR -> clients and non-clients
3. advertisements from eBGP -> goes to all iBGP neighbors
4. adveristements from iBGP -> goes to all eBGP neighbors
