it's better to use loobacks as the source IP instead of using the physical interface, in case the link goes down.
by default BGP will use the physical interface and it won't work unless you tell it to use the loopback
this is the reason for the update-source command, which changes the source IP to what you want it to be.


update-source is typically used on iBGP sessions, that are generally multihop and between router's loopback addresses. 
I often see people configuring update-source on directly connected eBGP session but this is by no mean needed.
