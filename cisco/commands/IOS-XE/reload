reload at 
	• specify a specific time, up to 24 days in the future
	• must set clock first
reload cancel  
	• aborts the schedule
reload in 5 
	• can specify minutes or hours and minutes   
	• this is useful if making changes on a remote switch, and you have a concern that changes you make might cause a loss of connection to that switch, assuming not saved, and it will come up with the last saved config.

if you reload it and no NTP server, it won't know what time it is, and you have to change the clock on it manually.

It might also not be able to reach the NTP server if it has an old battery that resets the clock, and a routing protocol authentication that won't let NTP pass.  SO you have to go out and fix it by console.
